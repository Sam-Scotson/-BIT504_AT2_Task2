# Tic-Tac-Toe Game Development README

## Overview
This project is about me finishing a Tic-Tac-Toe game someone else has started. The code already has some parts done, and there are comments marked with "TODO" that tell yme what I need to work on next. The game shows Noughts and Crosses on a canvas using a `JPanel`.

## Project Structure
The code has several Java classes:
- **GameBoard**: Manages the game board display.
- **GameController**: Handles game rules and player moves.
- **Player**: Sets up player details.
- **Main**: Starts the game.
